Code for "Exact statistical analysis for response-adaptive clinical trials: A general and computationally tractable approach"

The Julia files are for calculating OCs, while the Python files are for generating tables and figures.

full_evaluation_tests_RDP.jl generates the OCs for each row (value of N) in Figure 1 of the paper for RDP. 
to do this, run full_evaluation_tests_RDP(N, false , false) for N = 60, 240, 960.

full_evaluation_tests_EA.jl generates the OCs for each row (value of N) in Figure 5 of the supplement for EA.
to do this, run full_evaluation_tests_EA(N, false , false) for N = 60, 240, 960.

The results generated by these Julia scripts are used by 
generate_results_comparison_tests.py 
to generate either Fig. 2 (and Table 2,3,4 in the supplement) or Fig. 5 (also Table 5,6,7 in the supplement)  (in data/figures/) by setting the variable called "policy" to either "RDP" or "EA".

calculate_OCs_ARREST_trial.jl can be run to generate the results for Fig. 3 in the paper and Fig. 6 in the supplement.

generate_results_arrest_paper.py generates Fig 3. in the paper (in data/figures).

generate_results_arrest_paper.py generates Fig 6. in the paper and Table 11 (in data/figures/ and data/).

calculate_OCs_M_PTW_trial.jl generates the results for Figure 2 of the paper and Table 10 in the supplement.

generate_results_M_PTW.py generates Figure 2 and Table 10 of the paper.

All data can be generated by running the code, in addition the first author can be contacted for the data.
